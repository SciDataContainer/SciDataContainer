# SciDataContainer

This is a lean container file format for scientific data, in a way compliant to the [FAIR principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) of modern research data management. Using a standardized container file it provides maximum flexibility and minimal restrictions for scientists working in the lab or performing simulations. Data containers may be stored as local files or uploaded to a data storage server. The container is based on the well-known ZIP format and thus independent of the operating system as well as programming languages.

In the folder `python` you find a Python 3 implementation. The full [documentation](https://github.com/reincas/scidatacontainer) of the container format together with all supported language implementations is hosted on [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).
