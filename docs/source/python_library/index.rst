Python Library
==============

This is the Python 3 implementation of a :doc:`scidatacontainer </index>`.

The class is operating system independent.

However, this container class makes these tasks much more convenient for Python programmers.

You may use the function ``scidatacontainer.timestamp()`` to generate this string.

In order to simplify the generation of meta data, the data container class will try to insert default values for the author name and e-mail address (see :doc:`configuration`).

The easiest way to install the latest version of the `scidatacontainer <https://pypi.org/project/scidatacontainer/>`_ python library is using PIP:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install scidatacontainer


.. toctree::
