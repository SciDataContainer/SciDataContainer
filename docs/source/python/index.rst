Python Library
==============

This is the Python 3 implementation of ``SciDataContainer``. The implementation is operating system independent. In order to simplify the generation of meta data, the ``Container`` class will try to insert default values for the author name and e-mail address from the `configuration file <../configuration.html#scidata>`_.

The easiest way to install the latest version of the `scidatacontainer <https://pypi.org/project/scidatacontainer/>`_ package is using PIP:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install scidatacontainer
