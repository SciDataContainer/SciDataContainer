Welcome to scidatacontainer's documentation!
============================================
This is a lean container class for the storage of scientific data, in a way compliant to the `FAIR principles <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data>`_ of modern research data management.
Using a standardized container file it provides maximum flexibility and minimal restrictions.
Data containers may be stored as local files and uploaded to a data storage server.
The class is operating system independent.
This is a project of the cluster of Excellence `PhoenixD <https://www.phoenixd.uni-hannover.de>`_ and the data server is currently only available for PhoenixD members.
However, we intend to make the whole project including the server publicly available.
If you are from outside PhoenixD and wish to get early access, you are welcome.
Please contact us.
